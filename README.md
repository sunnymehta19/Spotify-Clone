# Spotify-Clone
A front-end Spotify Clone web application built entirely with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project replicates the basic look and feel of Spotify, allowing users to play/pause songs, navigate playlists, and enjoy a clean, interactive UI â€” all without any external frameworks or libraries.
